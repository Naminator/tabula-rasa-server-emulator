# InfiniteRasa : a Tabula Rasa Server Emulator #

_Missing RG's Tabula Rasa universe ?_
_Ever dreamt of its rebirth one day ?_

Well, that's what this project is about !

This server/emulator project will be a basis for re-building the TR universe, with full compatibility with the TR client v1.11.
As we don't aim to reproduce the original worlds, we will welcome suggestions and ideas to help us improving this awesome game to its most !

We are always looking in motivated C++ / C# developers, skilled in Game Servers, Artificial intelligence, Networking and Web development.

If you have suffered, like us, on the brutal and unjustified extinction of the official game servers, come on board now to help us resurrecting TabulaRasa !
